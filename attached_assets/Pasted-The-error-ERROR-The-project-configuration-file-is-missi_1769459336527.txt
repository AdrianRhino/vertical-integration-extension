The error [ERROR] The project configuration file is missing required fields from the HubSpot CLI means that a necessary field or value is absent in one of your project's configuration files, likely hsproject.json, a *-hsmeta.json file, or potentially the global ~/.hscli/config.yml file. 
Troubleshooting Steps
Identify the Missing Field: The error message usually specifies which file and which field is missing. Review the full error output in your terminal for details.
Verify Project Configuration Files: Check the relevant configuration file for the missing field.
hsproject.json: This file must be at the root of your project directory and contains top-level project configuration.
*-hsmeta.json files: These files configure specific project components (like CMS assets or app features) and are located within the src directory.
hubspot.config.yml (deprecated) or ~/.hscli/config.yml (global config): This configuration file manages your HubSpot accounts and authentication details. A common issue here is a missing defaultPortal setting or missing variable values if you are using config profiles.
Ensure all Variables have Values: If you are using config profiles (using the --profile or -p flag with hs project upload or hs project dev), you must ensure that every variable defined in your configuration files has a corresponding value in the specified profile.
Use CLI Commands to Fix/Create Files:
To create a new, correctly structured project configuration file, use the hs project create command.
To manage or fix account authentication issues in your global config file, use the hs account auth or hs config migrate commands.
You can list authenticated accounts using hs accounts to verify your setup.
Check for Typos and Format: Ensure all fields match the required schema and are correctly formatted (e.g., property names in APIs often require their "external name" not their display label). 
By checking the specific file mentioned in the error message and reviewing the required fields based on the HubSpot Developers documentation, you should be able to resolve the issue.
